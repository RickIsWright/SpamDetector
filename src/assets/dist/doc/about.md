## Description
Piranha CMS provides a feature to allow visitors to comment posts and pages. 
This module adds automatic spam detection functionality for these comments.
Once configured, the module will intercept all comments before they are published. 
If considered spam, the comment is marked as not approved, effectively stopping it from being published.
If not considered spam, the comment is marked as approved and is published.
