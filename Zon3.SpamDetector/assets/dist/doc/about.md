Piranha CMS provides a feature to allow visitors to comment posts and pages. 
Out of the box, there is no mechanism to prevent spamming the site with unsolicited comments.
This module adds automatic spam detection functionality for submitted comments. 
It does so by using the free to use Akismet service for spam detection.
Once configured, the module will intercept all comments before they are published. 
If considered spam, the comment is marked as not approved, effectively stopping it from being published.
If not considered spam, the comment is marked as approved and is published.
